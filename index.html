      <p class="bio">
        Fascinated by the way web products can influence perception, shape
        opinions and create feelings, I decided to pursue the journey of web
        programming with a current focus on front-end developing. <br />
        <br />
        I have found great joy in creating eye-pleasing, interactive and
        intuitive websites, as well as web and mobile apps. <br />
        <br />
        Curiosity is my biggest trait as well as a flaw. It is what drives me to
        be endlessly commited to my work, or boring about it, depending on who
        you ask. <br />
        <br />
        As a self-taugh developer, perseverance and adaptivness are right there
        next to programming as the things I learnt in the last few years.
        <br />
        <br />
        I consider developing a skill never completely learnt, thankfully that
        aligns with my unfullfing need to constantly learn, explore and improve.
        <br />
        <br />
        Altough I am currently focused on front-end developing, when I close my
        eyes the sight of becoming a full-stack developer is more clear every
        day. One could say I took the quote
        <span class="quote"
          >"A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than
          a master of one"</span
        >
        quite personally.

        Building this portfolio website was a way of affirming what I have
        learnt so far, therefor I consider it my first project.
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to attain as much knowledge as possible, I avoided using
        libraries and relied on HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript. That being said,
        my latest project was built exactly like that.
        <br /><br />
        I am currently refactoring my code and the projects will be up for show
        in no time!
